Students with a print disability, with difficulties with taking notes, memory and concentration may spend substantial processing capacity on entirely different tasks All students new to e-learning are trying to find new ways to learn and consume mathematics. This will require them to interact with resources in new ways and will impact their processing capacity. "],

All students, but especially those with e.g. Dyslexia, will benefit from interactive and responsive resources which are colourful, have well rendered maths and graphics and are enriched with video and audio. Go for it! But such resources can raise practical and technical barriers for some if poorly made: Complex navigation and accurate input may be difficult keyboard only or pointer only Maths needs to be chunkable and navigable for speech, magnification, Braille and small screens Use of colour-only to give meaning is a problem Raster graphics do not magnify/zoom well Responsive pages with multiple foci hard for VI users "],
["structure.html", "2.1 Structure", " 2.1 Structure Computers rely on structural integrity to process maths: PDF, print, handwriting and E-books using images of maths cannot be processed They are inaccessible and inflexible on, for instance, small screen devices. They are lossy formats for maths! Word, HTML based formats and EPub3 have structural integrity for maths and are accessible to many assistive technologies (AT) But not all AT can access maths all formats - right now we probably need to produce as much choice as possible PowerPoint 365 is theoretically accessible but most AT won’t work with it yet and it can’t be transformed Using AT effectively for maths requires authors to produce accessible materials "],

From a technical point of view there are only three formats of mathematical text which are accessible: HTML using MathJax to render the mathematics Word EPub3 Whatever other formats you supply you must supply at least one or, ideally, all of these (some technology can only access one format, EPub3 has least software support). Supply your course content ‘spine’ in this format. But you also need to supply PDF! Not all accessibility is about technical access - for some a clear or large print PDF is best Clear print is selected most often by disabled students in the Department of Mathematical Sciences. "],

Check that mathematics is rendered via MathJax Add subtitles/closed captions to video We do this by upload to YouTube, wait for automatic captions to be provided, download as transcript, correct in a text editor, upload, get YouTube to sync and then download as subtitles and add as a subtitle track using. Don’t avoid using something if it currently can’t be made accessible - Geogebra isn’t fully accessible but it is really great for many disabled students. Provide an alternative way to access the same content or experience. Tell students what is and isn’t accessible and who to contact if it is a problem. Know what you will do if they contact you! 3.3.2 Desmos Desmos is screenreader accessible and also produces tactile diagrams. If you can redraw the graph in Desmos then do that and put a “Link to accessible Desmos sheet: LINK” in as the alterative text. So that none screenreader users can find the Desmos graph as well (it might help them too) put a link somewhere else as well. 3.3.3 BrailleR If you are making some sorts of statistical graphs and you know how to use R (fairly well) then there is a BrailleR package which can create descriptions of some sorts of graphs automatically. 3.3.4 Output from code (and data) If you made a diagram using data or code or some textbased input mechanism then provide that text or link to it somehow. 3.3.5 All of the rest DIAGRAM Center (http://diagramcenter.org/) has some great resources for those new to diagram description: Poet Image Description Training Tool Image description guidelines Sample book Webinar: http://diagramcenter.org/diagramwebinars.html#compleximages UKAAF has guidance on accessible images: https://www.ukaaf.org/accessible-images/ NCAM (Old site) has guidelines and examples: http://ncamftp.wgbh.org/ncam-old-site/experience_learn/educational_media/stemdx.html 3.3.6 If having used the above you just don’t know what to do? Some diagrams actually are so complex that a text description is unhelpful or they have a particular visual function, in that they are not required to communicate the mathematical nature of the object but they are required for the learner to grasp a visualisation of the object which in itself is needed somehow (e.g. image of a Klein bottle is a 2D representation of a 4D object embedded into 3D space, trying to describe it or make a tactile diagram is never going to work as well as the visual does for a sighted person as simply handing a blind person an appropriately well-made model, don’t be afraid to say “too complex/whatever for description, please request a tactile graphic from INSERT MAIL ADDRESS or a model from INSERT MAIL ADDRESS”) "],

The past: Try to use tools which may or may not work and that cannot tell you, in general why something doesn’t work The future? lwarp but beware of some hard work (documentation currently 1237 pages) - what happens depends on what you are doing in LaTeX and how and you have to work that out and test for accessibility for yourself. It is not possible to convert LaTeX to html in the general case. I’m not sure how to produce Word or EPub but it is probably possible e.g. via Pandoc Easiest: Use (R)Markdown/Bookdown, incorporating LaTeX for equations and a simple markup language for the rest of the document. You will be confined to a transformable subset with will a quick compile loop. The output has known accessibility features. It is still extensible, just more reasonably so. 3.4.1 Markdown/RMarkdown/Bookdown More information on getting started with RMarkdown see Using R as a basis for writing an accessible mathematical document But, you will probably want Bookdown or more eventually: Theorem 3.1: Bookdown is needed for things like theorems and internal references Now go to 3.1. 3.4.2 Work in progress: Claverton Down Added over the top of Bookdown and aimed specifically at making resources for students. * This document and the variants are produced using it. For instance: Thought 3.1: You can create new theorem types Nugget 3.2: And you can have theorem types share numbering Information about how to access and use this will be at ClavertonDown At some point the name might change if it is used outside of Bath!
