From a technical point of view there are only two formats of mathematical text which are accessible: HTML using MathJax to render the mathematics Word Whatever other formats you supply you must supply one or, ideally, both of these (some technology can only access one or the other). But you also need to supply PDF! Not all accessibility is about technical access - for some a clear or large print PDF is best Clear print is selected most often by disabled students in the Department of Mathematical Sciences. "],
